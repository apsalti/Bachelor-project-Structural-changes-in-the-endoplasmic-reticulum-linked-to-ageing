# Bachelor project: Structural changes in the endoplasmic reticulum linked to ageing
## Introduction
The aim of my bachelor project was to link ageing to structural changes in the ER. I was successufl in finding that link, I additionnally found a marker of senescence in the cell nucelus. 

## Breif method
I used mouse liver for all my experiments, female and male at 3 months old and 24 months old. The livers were put in OCT, sliced, stained, imaged, segmented and analyzed. 

## Code 
The data_analysis_1.ipynb file is the raw file with all my trial and error.
The final_code.ipynb is the code that provides the results that I use in my submitted thesis.
### Required packages
The required packages are numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scipy, seaborn and sklearn. I ran the code on a MacOS Monterey 12.5.1 with a Apple M1 Pro chip.

## Acknowledgements
A special thanks to the Quake lab at Stanford University for hosting me, Douglas Henze for supervising my project and Prof. Bart Deplancke for overseeing my thesis.
